        <p>Ninjas can kill anyone they want!  Ninjas cut off heads ALL the time and don't even think twice about it.  
            These guys are so crazy and awesome that they flip out ALL the time.  I heard that there was this ninja who
            was eating at a diner.  And when some dude dropped a spoon the ninja killed the whole town.  My friend Mark
            said that he saw a ninja totally uppercut some kid just because the kid opened a window.</p>
